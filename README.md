Design Choices
The website features a modern and professional design for TechNova Solutions, an AI & Cloud consulting company. I chose a clean, minimalist layout with a dark color scheme and accent colors to convey technological sophistication. The design incorporates ample white space and a hierarchical typography system to enhance readability and user experience. The responsive design ensures seamless viewing across all devices, with a hamburger menu for mobile navigation.

JavaScript Features
Form Validation: Implemented comprehensive client-side validation for the contact form, including email format verification and minimum length requirements for name, subject, and message fields.
Mobile Navigation: Created an interactive hamburger menu for mobile devices that smoothly toggles the navigation links.
Smooth Scrolling: Added smooth scrolling behavior for internal page links to improve user experience.
Interactive UI Elements: Incorporated hover effects and transitions for buttons and navigation elements.
Development Challenges
The main challenge was ensuring consistent styling across different browsers while maintaining responsive design principles. This was overcome by implementing standardized CSS reset rules and using flexible units (rem, em) for measurements. Another challenge was optimizing the mobile navigation experience, which was resolved by implementing a clean hamburger menu solution with JavaScript.

Deployment Process
The website was deployed using vercel for reliable and free hosting. The deployment process involved:

Creating a GitHub repository
Pushing the optimized code and assets
Configuring vercel in the repository settings
Testing the live site across multiple devices and browsers
