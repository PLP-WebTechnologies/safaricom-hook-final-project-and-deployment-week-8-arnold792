### **Assignment: Final Project â€“ Designing, Coding, and Deploying a Multipage Website** 

---

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this assignment is to create a **multipage website** that is fully designed, coded, and deployed on a hosting platform. By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of **front-end web development**, including **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, and **deployment** to live servers. This will showcase your ability to build a **responsive** and **interactive** website that is ready for production.

---

### **Project Requirements:**

1. **Website Design**:
   - **Design a website** that has at least **three pages** (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
   - Each page should have **unique content** but maintain a consistent layout and design (using a **common theme** or **template**).
   - The website should be **responsive**, meaning it must look good and function properly on devices of all sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - You are encouraged to use **modern design trends** (flat design, minimalism, or material design) and **UI/UX principles**.

2. **HTML5 Structure**:
   - Use semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.).
   - Ensure the website has a **navigation menu** that allows users to navigate between pages.

3. **CSS3 Styling**:
   - Create a **style sheet** using **CSS3** to design your website (you may use **CSS frameworks** like **Bootstrap** or **TailwindCSS** to speed up the process, but it is not mandatory).
   - Implement **CSS3 transitions** and **animations** to enhance interactivity (e.g., hover effects, smooth scrolling, fade-in elements).
   - Make sure your website is **responsive**, using **media queries** to adjust the layout for various screen sizes.

4. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Incorporate **JavaScript** to add interactivity to your website (e.g., form validation, image sliders, modals, or interactive maps).
   - Use **event listeners** (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`) for user interactions.
   - Ensure **form validation** is functional for all forms on the website (e.g., contact form, subscription form).

5. **Optimizations**:
   - Optimize your images (compress them without losing quality).
   - Minify your CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Test your website on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices to ensure compatibility.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy your website to a **hosting platform**. Choose one of the following platforms for deployment:
     - **GitHub Pages**
     - **Netlify**
     - **Vercel**
   - Ensure that your website is **live** and accessible on the internet via a unique URL.

### **Deliverables:**

1. **Website Files**:
   - HTML files for each page (e.g., `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`).
   - CSS file(s) for styling.
   - JavaScript file(s) for functionality.
   - All images and assets used in the project (stored in an `assets/` folder).
   - README.md file with a description of the project and instructions on how to run it locally.

2. **Live Website**:
   - Provide a **link to the live website** deployed on your chosen hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
   - Ensure that the website is fully functional, responsive, and looks good across devices.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Write a brief **documentation** (100-200 words) explaining:
     - Your design choices (why you chose the layout, colors, etc.).
     - The features you implemented using **JavaScript** (e.g., form validation, interactive elements).
     - Any challenges you faced during development and how you overcame them.
     - The deployment process you followed.

### **Project Documentation**

#### Design Choices
The website features a modern and professional design for TechNova Solutions, an AI & Cloud consulting company. I chose a clean, minimalist layout with a dark color scheme and accent colors to convey technological sophistication. The design incorporates ample white space and a hierarchical typography system to enhance readability and user experience. The responsive design ensures seamless viewing across all devices, with a hamburger menu for mobile navigation.

#### JavaScript Features
- **Form Validation**: Implemented comprehensive client-side validation for the contact form, including email format verification and minimum length requirements for name, subject, and message fields.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Created an interactive hamburger menu for mobile devices that smoothly toggles the navigation links.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Added smooth scrolling behavior for internal page links to improve user experience.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Incorporated hover effects and transitions for buttons and navigation elements.

#### Development Challenges
The main challenge was ensuring consistent styling across different browsers while maintaining responsive design principles. This was overcome by implementing standardized CSS reset rules and using flexible units (rem, em) for measurements. Another challenge was optimizing the mobile navigation experience, which was resolved by implementing a clean hamburger menu solution with JavaScript.

#### Deployment Process
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages for reliable and free hosting. The deployment process involved:
1. Creating a GitHub repository
2. Pushing the optimized code and assets
3. Configuring GitHub Pages in the repository settings
4. Testing the live site across multiple devices and browsers
